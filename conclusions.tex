\osprey has long offered unique capabilities to protein designers.  In particular, it has always offered a unique combination of free energy-based modeling, provably accuracy conformational search, continuous flexibility, and efficient search over large sequence spaces.  In \osprey 3 we introduce software improvements that will make this algorithm much more practical for the wider design community: performance that is orders of magnitude faster, and a Python interface that makes \osprey much easier to use.  On top of this, we expand the range of biophysical modeling assumptions that \osprey can accommodate, both in terms of flexibility and energy functions.  We hope this new version will be of significant utility to designers, whether they have used \osprey before or are trying it for the first time.
